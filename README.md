## Design
 * Why did we choose asp mvc over other tools, pros & cons of each
 * Design patterns you used in the application (MVC)
 * Sequence diagram of how various, happy path of user setting up their profile 

## Wiremocks - you have these already.. 

## Project management
 - Bunch of stories
 - write about how we tackled each week, 
 - gave ourself a small goal each week
 -  Story is 'Create a profile page'
 -  As a user I want to be able to edit my profile screen
 -  When I click on the My Profile Button
 -  Then a new screen gets displayed with 5 fields capturning my profis
 -  Then when I click save I will be routed/navigated to a new the landing page displaying my profile date on the left side of the screeen.

## Estimations

We use story points for estimating complexity. 
It uses the standard fibonacci sequence for story estimation. 
 - 1 point - 1 hour
 - 2 points - 2-4 hours
 - 3 points - 4-8 hours
 - 5 points - 8-16 hours
 - 8 points - 16-32 hours

We don't go more than 8 points. If the story was given an estimate greater than 8 points, we would go and break down the story into smaller components so that we could give a more realistic estimate.
